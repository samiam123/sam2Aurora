Adding, Updating, and Removing Regions

How to add another region in grid mode:

    To add another region, you'll have to copy the bin folder to another location, making sure to remove the
	sim.sim file (as that contains the region info from the old bin folder) and configure it to have a different
	http port (in Aurora.ini [Network] section), as well as configuring the new region that you'll set up to
	have a different internal port (set up when adding a region).
	
How to remove a region in grid mode:
    
	To remove a region, simply don't start that region's Aurora.exe file, and to remove it from the map, switch to
	Aurora.Server.exe and type 'grid clear region <name>'.
	
How to update a region:

    To update region information such as Name, Position, etc, type 'update region info' on the region console.
	To update estate information, such as the estate you are in, type 'change estate' on the region console.

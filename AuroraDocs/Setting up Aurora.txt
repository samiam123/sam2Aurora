## Readme
##

If you are using a release, skip down to the next section, otherwise, read on
If you are using the master build, you will need to compile Aurora-Sim before you can use it.
  To do this, follow the instructions in Compiling.txt for your system before continuing on with
  this tutorial.


##
## Setting up Aurora-Sim
##
  The first thing is to figure out which mode of Aurora-Sim you wish to run.
  If you want to run one sim and disallow remote sim connections, you want to run standalone,
      and should jump to the standalone section of this file.
  If you want to run more than one sim and allow remote sim connections, you want to run grid
      mode, and should jump to the grid section of this file.
	  
	  
##
## Standalone Mode
##
  To run Aurora-Sim in standalone mode, just run Aurora.exe, and enter yes to allow it to 
      configure itself with the inputs from you.
	  
##
## Grid Mode
##
  To run Aurora-Sim in grid mode, first run Aurora.Server.exe, and enter yes to allow it to
      configure itself with the inputs from you. This sets up the server that deals with 
	  viewer connections (mainly logins).
  Next, you'll want to run the following secondary servers,
      Aurora.AssetServer.exe
	  Aurora.AvatarServer.exe
	  Aurora.GridServer.exe
	  Aurora.InventoryServer.exe
  These do what the names suggest they do, and help balance the load of the regions on your grid.
  Next, you'll start Aurora.exe, and enter yes to allow it to configure itself (make sure to set it
      up in grid mode!) with the inputs from you. 
  Your grid is now fully configured, and to restart it, just start the same .exe files as above (without
      re-configuring the grid) in the same order.

##
## Running all servers just in Aurora.Server.exe (like Aurora was before, or Robust)
##

  To combine all of the Aurora.*Server.exe back into Aurora.Server.exe, open
    Aurora.Server.ini
    and look for [Handlers] and go to the bottom of that config.
	You'll see an area that is commented out that says that it is the area to
	set up Aurora.Server to run all of the services. 
	Uncomment 
	Include-Single = AuroraServerConfiguration/SingleServerInstance.ini
	Now you only have to run Aurora.Server.exe.
	
##
## Setting up standalone to allow remote connections
##
  To allow standalone Aurora.exe to allow remote connections (like grid mode can),
    you'll be doing some major config changes! 
    If you're doing this, you had better have a good reason to!
	YOU WILL NOT GET ANY ASSISTANCE IF YOU ARE TRYING TO DO THIS.
  In essence, what you have to do is to enable the server handlers for Aurora.exe
	which is possible, it's just not very pretty.
	To do this, you'll have to open up Standalone.ini, and find the [Handlers]
	section, and add in 
	
	#START COPYING
	
	LLLoginHandlerPort = 8002 ;;If you want to change this to 8002

    SyncMessagePosterServiceOpenServerHandler = true
    SyncMessagePosterServiceServerHandlerPort = 8014
	SyncMessagePosterServiceDoRemote = true
    InstantMessagingServiceOpenServerHandler = true
    InstantMessagingServiceServerHandlerPort = 8014
    AssetServiceOpenServerHandler = true
    AssetServiceServerHandlerPort = 8010
    AvatarServiceOpenServerHandler = true
    AvatarServiceServerHandlerPort = 8011
    GridServiceOpenServerHandler = true
    GridServiceServerHandlerPort = 8012
    InventoryServiceOpenServerHandler = true
    InventoryServiceServerHandlerPort = 8013
    UserAccountServiceOpenServerHandler = true
    UserAccountServiceServerHandlerPort = 8015
	
	#END COPYING
	
	Then in [AuroraConnectors],
	
	#START COPYING
	
	DoRemoteCalls = False
    AllowRemoteCalls = True
	
	#END COPYING
	
  This enables all of the remote listening handlers, so that other Aurora.exe 
	instances can connect to Aurora.exe as if it were Aurora.Server.exe

## Running a grid of standalone Aurora.exe services all with one database
##

This is possible... if you can do it, congratulations, you know the configs 
  and how they interact with Aurora very well!

##
## Running a region on Aurora.Server.exe
##

This too is possible, and if you can do it, congratulations, just like above.

##
## Tips on speeding up closed grids
##
	
1: Disable remote services for Aurora.exe in grid mode
    EG. Disabling the remote asset connector, and just have it directly
	    access the database, so that Aurora.Server isn't as necessary.
2. I'll think of more things I've done later...

##  Creating an avatar archive
##
To create an avatar archive, you'll first set up a user on your sim, and have that user wear all of 
   the clothing and attachments that you want the archive to have.
After this is done, then you'll type the following into the console

save avatar archive <First> <Last> <Filename> <FolderNameToSaveInto> (--snapshot <UUID>) (--private)

in which <First> is the user from above's first name, <Last> is the user from above's last name,
  <Filename> is the file that you want to save it into (add the extension .aa),
  <FolderNameToSaveInfo> is the folder name that will be created when this is loaded into a new
  avatar. The last two parameters are optional, but necessary for setting up default avatars.
  Adding "--snapshot <UUID>" will assign a screenshot to the archive, allowing a picture of it to be
  set for the web interface. Adding "--private" will not allow the archive to be found by the web interface,
  and it's existance will disallow the archives use for default avatars.

##  Setting up default avatars
##
Once you have followed the step above for all default avatars, and you have set them all to have "--public", 
  you are all set, and the default avatars will now show up in the registration page. Note that you must leave the 
  .aa files in the bin directory where the web interface is run though for them to be loaded.

##  Loading an avatar archive
##
If you want to load an avatar archive to a user (and replace their current appearance), you can load
an archive. To do this, make sure that the user is not logged in, then type the following into the console

load avatar archive <First> <Last> <Filename>

in which <First> is the user from above's first name, <Last> is the user from above's last name,
  <Filename> is the file that you want to load (including the extension .aa). Once you type this, 
  it will load the archive, and the avatar will be wearing the clothes from the archive the next time they log in.

    ;; The modules that are currently available are GenericVoice, MurmurVoice, and FreeSwitchVoice
    ;; If you do not wish to use voice, use the GenericVoice module so that the client is happy.

    ;; You must have a Mumble server already set up to use Murmur
    ;; New, incompatible voice daemon which will do speaker indication,
    ;; positional voice, and high quality audio codec. Host voice on the
    ;; same server, or use Glacier2 to proxy the insecure ICE protocol.

[VivoxVoice]
    ; The VivoxVoice module will allow you to provide voice on your
    ; region(s). It uses the same voice technology as the LL grid and
    ; works with recent LL clients (we have tested 1.22.9.110075, so
    ; anything later ought to be fine as well).
    ;

    ; that allows you to create voice accounts and region channels.
